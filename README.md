COPD Care is an application prototype developed by Lily Hung, Anton Santos, Karen Zhao, Nayesha Khurana for UBC BizTech's hackathon, HelloHacks 2023.

This is intended to be(come) a mobile and Apple Watch application that:
- automatically tracks key indicators for an oncoming COPD exacerbation (pulse, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation).
- uses baseline values and trends to predict exacerbations and categorize risk levels
- allows for manual symptom input and generates personalized reports
- facilitates appointment booking for care

Unique features we hoped to develop include:
- Automated tracking of vitals
- 5 day prediction of exacerbations
- Integration of educational content and actionable recommendations
